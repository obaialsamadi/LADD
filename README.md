# LADD: Linux and DevOps Dump
** UPDATE **
I'm working on moving the content (this and stuff I haven't uploaded yet) to my own blog online hosted on AWS with some juicy AWS networking and architecture details, which will include a lesson on exactly how to do that yourself. Stay tuned!

## What's in Here
A whole **bunch** of notes about things you'd need to get started as a DevOps Engineer and even Linux knowledge. It's probably not enough. It's never enough, but that's the fun of it. I have been shoving a heap of information in my head about Linux, DevOps tools and culture, and everything around that and dumping them into markdown files here so I can have quick access. I am working on making the notes better so anyone could read and benefit, but work is pretty time consuming so bare with me while I update this repo.

## Quick Bio
I'm an aspiring DevOps Engineer looking to become better and better in this field. Given that my school program never went anywhere near anything remotely related to DevOps tools, I had to find somewhere I could begin; a tangible thread to grab and follow. A friend told me about Linux Academy and lo and behold, they have a _Junior DevOps Engineer_ path. I bought a membership without thinking twice (well I checked them out first and determined it's worth it but you know) because I figured investing in that would give me a visible and concrete direction to follow in terms of learning. I currently work for a startup doing DevOps related tasks.
