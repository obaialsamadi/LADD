# LADD: Linux and DevOps Dump

## Quick Bio
I'm a freshly graduated Computer Engineer aspiring to become a DevOps Engineer. Given that my school program never went anywhere near anything remotely related to DevOps tools, I had to find somewhere I could begin; a tangible thread to grab and follow. A friend told me about Linux Academy and lo and behold, they have a _Junior DevOps Engineer_ path. I bought a membership without thinking twice (well I checked them out first and determined it's worth it but you know) because I figured investing in that would give me a visible and concrete direction to follow in terms of learning. I currently work for a startup doing DevOps tasks.

## What's in Here
A whole **bunch** of notes about things you'd need to get started as a DevOps Engineer and even Linux knowledge. It's probably not enough. It's never enough, but that's the fun of it. If you want the direct view of what a typical DevOps job tasks would look like, go to the _CI/CD Pipeline: Extensive Guide_ markdown file. I have been shoving a heap of information in my head about Linux, DevOps tools and culture, and everything around that and dumping them into markdown files. I am working on making the notes better so anyone could read and benefit, but work is pretty time consuming so bare with me while I update this repo.
