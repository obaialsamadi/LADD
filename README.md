# DevOps Lessons Repo

## Quick Bio
I'm a freshly graduated Computer Engineer aspiring to become a DevOps Engineer. Given that my school program never went anywhere near anything remotely related to DevOps tools, I had to find somewhere I could begin; a tangible thread to grab and follow. A friend told me about Linux Academy and lo and behold, they have a _Junior DevOps Engineer_ path. I bought a membership without thinking twice (well I checked them out first and determined it's worth it but you know) because I figured investing in that is better than swimming in Google's ocean of resources. It felt like a visible and concrete direction I could trust. I currently work for a startup doing DevOps tasks.

## What's in Here
A whole **bunch** of notes about things you'd need to get started as a DevOps Engineer and even Linux knowledge. It's probably not enough. It's never enough, but that's the fun of it. If you want the direct view of what a typical DevOps job tasks would look like, go to the _CI/CD Pipeline: Extensive Guide_ markdown file. I have been shoving a heap of information in my head about Linux, DevOps tools and culture, and everything around that and dumping them into markdown files. I am working on making the notes better so anyone could read and benefit.

I'm working on applying what they're teaching me on Linux Academy in my own projects, not just their (amazing) Hands-On labs. I also don't want to upload their code. So as I go, I 'll be uploading actual code examples to compliment the markdown notes and updating them. It just takes time yafeel.
